# Learning objectives
```{marginfigure, echo=TRUE}
![](images/gglogo.png)
```
## After completing this tutorial you will be:

- Familiar with the concepts behind ggplot
- Familiar with the ggplot core syntax
- Able to create basic graphs using the ggplot elements

# Prerequisites

## Before starting this tutorial you should know:

- Your way around the RStudio interface
- Basic R syntax and concepts
- How to enter or download data into R
- How to navigate the R documentation
- How to install and call R packages
- Make sure you have the ggplot2 package installed

# What is ggplot?
```{r base-example, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Plot using base functions"}
mtcars2 <- mtcars
mtcars2$am <- factor(mtcars$am, labels = c("Sample 1", "Sample 2"))
mutate(mtcars2,manual = ifelse(am=="Sample 1",mpg,NA)) -> mtcars2
mutate(mtcars2,auto = ifelse(am=="Sample 2",mpg,NA)) -> mtcars2
plot(mtcars2$hp, mtcars2$auto,col="blue",pch="*",xlab="timepoints",ylab="activity",main="Two sample assay")
points(mtcars2$hp, mtcars2$manual, col="red",pch="+")
```
You may already be familiar with R's base plotting capabilities. Generally speaking, the base plotting functions tell R how to *draw* your graph. For example, base R plotting knows how to draw a bar graph, but we must tell it how to draw error bars. ggplot is an R package that implements a different way to instruct R to graph data by *declaring* the properties of the desired graph and having R/ggplot combine them.

```{r gg-example, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, fig.margin=TRUE, fig.cap="Plot using ggplot",message=FALSE}
ggplot(mtcars2, aes(x=hp,y=mpg,color=am)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth() + theme(legend.position="bottom") +
  labs(title="Two sample assay",
       x="timepoints",y="activity")
```
For very simple data graphics, base and ggplot code is not that much different. The power of ggplot starts to become apparent the more elaborate your visualization needs to be.

# Getting started

Make sure you have an R/RStudio install, settle into a working directory and, if you don't have ggplot installed:

```{marginfigure, echo=TRUE}
If you already installed the **tidyverse** package you don't need to install **ggplot2** since it is included
```
```{r}
install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)
```

# Comparison example

Let's start with plotting our old friend, the E.Coli strains dataset, with the base R plotting functions

```{marginfigure, echo=TRUE}
Making a scatter plot of the *genome_size* column of the dataset
```
```{r, eval=TRUE, message=FALSE, fig.margin=TRUE}
download.file(url="https://osf.io/ga9re/download", 
              destfile="ecolidata.csv")
straindata <- read.csv("ecolidata.csv")
genomesize <- straindata$genome_size
plot(genomesize)
```

So far, so good. To customize our plot, we need to refer to the graphical elements, like point symbol (pch) and title (main):

```{marginfigure, echo=TRUE}
The _pch_ parameter specifies the datapoint symbol and the _main_ parameter specifies the plot title
```
```{r}
plot(genomesize, pch=8, main="Scatter plot of genome sizes")
```

# The ggplot way...

With the Grammar of Graphics, we declare elements of our plot (variables, axes,...) and how they map to graphical characteristics. It's helpful to think about it as building the plot by layers.

```{marginfigure, echo=TRUE}
![](images/layers.png)
```
```{r}
ggplot(straindata) #Why is this blank?
ggplot(straindata) + geom_point() #Check the error message
```

ggplot expects that we declare the mapping of variables to visuals before plotting.
Note also how the plot can be built by *adding* elements and layers.

```{marginfigure, echo=TRUE}
![](images/syntax.png)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=straindata, mapping=aes(x=sample, y=genome_size))
#data= and mapping= are optional
```

Now let's add how we want the points to look like:

```{r}
ggplot(data=straindata, mapping=aes(x=sample, y=genome_size)) +
  geom_point()
# Data layer + Mapping layer + Points layer
```

Let's customize a bit more but, to save typing, let's start storing our plot into an object:

```{r}
myplot <- ggplot(data=straindata,
                 mapping=aes(x=sample, y=genome_size)) +
  geom_point()
myplot + ggtitle("Scatter plot of genome sizes")
myplot + ggtitle("Scatter plot of genome sizes") + theme_bw()
# Added a built-in theme to the theme layer
```

See the ggplot theme documentation for an idea of what other visual customizations can be made to the final look of the plot.

Visual elements, not just axes, can be mapped to variables. Can you tell what is going on here?

```{marginfigure, echo=TRUE}
Mapping multiple data variables to visual attributes of a 2D plot
```
```{r}
myfancyplot <- ggplot(straindata, aes(x=sample,
                                      y=genome_size,
                                      color=generation,
                                      shape=cit))+
  geom_point()
myfancyplot
```

Reading the geom_point documentation, we see that we can define visual attributes to customize, either by mapping them to variables or by specifying in them directly.
```{r geomtable, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
gtable <- data.frame("geom function" = "geom_point()",
                    "required mapping" = "x: , y:",
                    "optional mapping" = "color, size, fill, shape, alpha")
knitr::kable(gtable, caption = "geom_point()'s mappings")
```
# The boxplot example

Recall how we did a boxplot of this EColi data...

```{marginfigure, echo=TRUE}
*Y ~ X* is called _formula syntax_ in R
```
```{r}
boxplot(genome_size ~ cit, straindata,
        col=c("pink", "purple", "darkgrey"),
        main="Average Expresion Differences",
        ylab="Genome Size")
```

Below is the ggplot equivalent. Note that we can write the mapping inside the geom if we wish.

```{r, eval=TRUE,fig.margin=TRUE}
myboxplot <- ggplot(straindata) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=cit, y=genome_size, fill=cit))
myboxplot
myboxplot + ggtitle("Boxplot of genome size by citrate mutant")+
  xlab("Citrate mutant") +
  ylab("Genome Size (Mb)") # Text labels layer
```

To save plots from within R code:
```{r}
ggsave("boxplot.pdf", myboxplot)
```

So far, you should have _some_ idea of how the ggplot syntax works. For these simple plots, you may note that we don't save much in typing versus base plots (though we gain in better-looking plots by default). We will run through a few more examples to show some of the advantages versus base functions.

# Step-by-step: Make a volcano plot

From wikipedia:

>In statistics, a volcano plot is a type of scatter-plot that is used to quickly identify changes in large data sets composed of replicate data. It plots significance versus fold-change on the y and x axes, respectively. These plots are increasingly common in omic experiments such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics where one often has a list of many thousands of replicate data points between two conditions and one wishes to quickly identify the most meaningful changes. 

We want to make the graph below (more or less):

![Our volcano plot goal](images/volcano.png)
First, let's download and examine the data:
```{r}
download.file(url="https://osf.io/3rwmz/download",destfile="geneexpression.csv")
genedata <- read.csv("geneexpression.csv")
# Examine the genedata table, check data types and ranges
```
Look at the goal and ask:

- What are we mapping?
- What are the geometric objects and how do their properties match?

Remember you can save your "scratchpad" as an R script for future reference...

# Working with gapminder data

Next, we will work with the gapminder dataset, a table of country-wide statistics. You can just install the data as a package:

```{r}
# If you are on your own computer
install.packages("gapminder")
library(gapminder)
```

Remember to inspect your data after import...

# Plotting gapminder data

Let's start with a simple scatter of GDP per capita versus Life Expectancy

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point()
```

## Optional Exercise: Plot how life expectancy has changed over time

## Optional Exercise: Plot how life expectancy has changed over time per continent

Since we are looking at changes over time, maybe a line plot is better:

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp,
                             color=continent)) +
  geom_line()
```

Well, that's confusing. Can you tell why? (hint: look at how the data table is shaped)

```{r}
ggplot(data = gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp,
                             color=continent,
                             by=country)) +
  geom_line()
# by is a grouping parameter
```

What if we want both lines and points? Remember drawing is in layers:

```{r}
ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x = year, y = lifeExp,
                           by=country)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=continent)) +
  geom_point(color="black")
```

And now you see why we can write aes inside geoms: we may wish to map different variables/visuals to different elements of our plot. In this case, we drew a scatterplot on top of a line plot (Test for yourself by switching the order of the geoms). By the way, why did we not write an aes inside the geom_point in the example above?

# Plotting with transforms and stats

Let's go back to our first gapminder plot

```{r}
ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp,
                           color=continent)) +
  geom_point()
```

Points are kind of smushed together. We can make it easier to see by changing the x axis scale and by making them a bit transparent:

```{r}
firstgap <- ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=gdpPercap, y=lifeExp,
                                       color=continent)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_x_log10()
firstgap
```

Besides this kind of transform, we can add some fits to our plot:

```{r}
firstgap + geom_smooth(method="lm") #Trying a linear fit
```

Note that the geom_smooth layer took account of our global groupings before adding the fit. Also note how the modularity of the ggplot syntax makes it easier to modify the plot in non-trivial ways.

# More customization

Let's get back to our line plot. It was pretty busy. Faceting the data may make the data more readable:

```{r}
mylines <- ggplot(data=gapminder, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp,
                                      color=continent,
                                      by=country)) +
  geom_line()
mylines
mylines + facet_wrap( ~ country)
```

That's 142 plots. Takes a bit.

For the next example, let's try working on a subset of the countries...

```{r}
# grab first letter or country
beginletter <- substr(gapminder$country, start=1, stop=1)
# grab only the data from countries that start with A
A.countries <- gapminder[beginletter == "A", ]
Alineplot <- ggplot(data=A.countries, aes(x=year, y=lifeExp,
                                          color=continent)) +
  geom_line() + facet_wrap( ~ country)
Alineplot
```

So seven plots renders a bit quicker... Still, this ain't ready for publication quite yet. We can further customize the text by changing the label and theme layers:

```{marginfigure, echo=TRUE}
The parameters (x, y, color) passed to the *labs* function are visual attributes but not mapped to data variable names.

The *theme* function allows through its parameters to customize virtually any visual characteristic of the final plot, but there are pre-defined themes that can be used instead as a layer.
```
```{r}
Alineplot +
  labs(x="Year", y="Life Expectancy",
       title="Figure 1", color="Continent") +
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x=element_blank())
# Getting rid of x-ticks and text
```

## Optional exercise: Make a density plot (see geom_density documentation) of GDP per capita by continent, faceted per year

# Resources and where to go from here:

We've covered the very basics of plotting with ggplot (try a Google image search of 'ggplot' if you don't believe me). Below are some helpful resources to help you learn more:

- The ggplot official site (https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)

- The R for Data Science book (free at https://r4ds.had.co.nz) is pretty much indispensable to start learning how to do modern data analysis and data visualization with R/RStudio. Chapter 3 is all about 'ggplot'.

- Data Visualization: A practical introduction (free at https://socviz.co/) is a shorter introduction to the same topics, though not just visualizaiton. Though most of the examples are sociology-flavored, it may be a better starting point than the encyclopedic R4DS book.

- Another "cookbook" for ggplot code is maintained by Jennifer Bryan at (https://github.com/jennybc/r-graph-catalog)

- The *Awesome-R* site aggregates the best-loved resources and packages for R. Check out the Graphics section  (https://github.com/qinwf/awesome-R#graphic-displays) to see some of the 'ggplot' extensions available.

- To become a true ggplot expert, you'll probably have to go through Hadley Wickham's "ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis" book. Buy it from Amazon, request it from the library, or build it from source at (https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2-book).
